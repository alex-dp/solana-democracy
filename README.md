# Argon: a program suite for direct democracy on Solana

## UBI
You can sign up for an account and get a Civic uniqueness pass, then you'll be able to mint a token that accumulates with time. You can mint at most every 24 hours. Value accumulates to this token from fees collected on the platform.

## Petitions
This program allows token-gated petitions. There is a global uniqueness network provided by Civic. States can set up their own verification systems and gatekeeper networks and integrate permissionlessly.

## Fundraisers
Organizations and institutions can use this program to collect funds.

## Referenda
This program will use a similar "gating" mechanism to the petition program. Thanks to Light Protocol, you will be able to vote secretly on referenda in your gatekeeper networks.

## Elections
This program will use the technologies mentioned above to enable secure and configurable elections within gatekeeper networks.
